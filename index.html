    <h1>Nouman Ali Khan</h1>
    <p>Khan was born in <strong>1978,</strong> in East Germany to a Pakistani Punjabi family and spent his preschool
        years in the former East Berlin.He later lived in Saudi Arabia, where he attended the Pakistan Embassy School,
        before moving
        to New York as a teenager, during which he struggled with his faith, briefly identified as an atheist, and
        eventually became religious. He taught Arabic at Nassau Community College until 2006, after which he began
        working full-time on Bayyinah, through which he has taught over 10,000 students via seminars and programs.
        He was previously married to Sofia Sharieff.</p>

    <p>In September 2017, allegations of misconduct were made public against Khan involving inappropriate relationships
        with female followers. The allegations became public through a Facebook post by Omer M. Mozaffar, a
        Chicago-based Muslim chaplain brought in to mediate between Khan and scholars, who alleged that Khan had
        "confessed inappropriate interactions with various women, violating agreed-upon bounds of Islamic law."
        Khan disputed Mozaffar's claims and called the allegations an attempt to damage his reputation.</p><br>
